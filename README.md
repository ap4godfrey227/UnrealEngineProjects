# UnrealEngineWarehouseWreckage

This was an INSTRUCTOR-GUIDED project from this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/?kw=unreal&src=sac)

## Purpose of the Project
* Introduce the Unreal Engine 5 environment
* Learn simple video game design practices and theory
* Create a physics-based interactive experience using Blueprint
* Implement common basic practices of level design (i.e. limited ammo w/counter, level reloading upon objective complete, etc.)

## Intended Instructions/How to Play
* Simply begin the project and move around using the WASD keys and mouse to aim
* Press the spacebar to fire a projectile based on the current looking angle/position
* Knock over as many objects as you can with the 20 ammo you are granted
* Level will restart after expending all ammo
